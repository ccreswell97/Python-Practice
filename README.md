# My Python Sample programs

This repository contains all the programs I'm using keep up on my Python knowledge. 
I studied Python when I was getting my BS in Computer Science, but I haven't had a chance to use it at a job yet. However, I want to become a better Python programmer and keep my skills up, so I'm following along with tutorials and the Udemy course "100 days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022".

I already have intermediate knowledge of Python, but I'm still going to start with beginner programs so I can review the basics and make sure I have a solid understanding of Python syntax (since I've been using TypeScript and Java almost exclusively for the past 2 years).

## Visual Highlights

Some visual highlights of this repository include the program that re-creates a Hirst Dot Painting, my implementation of the Snake game, and my implemenation of Pong:

I really enjoyed creating this US States Guessing Game, where you guess the names of all the states in the US and it shows the name of the state on top of it on a map.

## Running the Code

If you want to run any of these programs on your local machine, you will need to have Python3 installed on your machine. Navigate to the place that you have cloned the repository in your terminal. (You might need other Python libraries to be installed as well, depending on the project - I use pip to install these.) Then, you can run each program like this:

    python3 <program_name>

For the small, single-file programs, this will be a specific name, like BandNameGenerator.py. For the larger projects, you will want to run the main.py file. So, your commands would look like this:

    python3 BandNameGenerator.py

OR

    python3 main.py
