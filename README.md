# My Python Sample programs

This repository contains all the programs I'm using keep up on my Python knowledge. 
I studied Python when I was getting my BS in Computer Science, but I haven't had a chance to use it at a job yet. However, I want to become a better Python programmer and keep my skills up, so I'm following along with tutorials and the Udemy course "100 days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022". 

I already have intermediate knowledge of Python, but I'm still going to start with beginner programs so I can review the basics and make sure I have a solid understanding of Python syntax (since I've been using TypeScript and Java almost exclusively for the past 2 years).

Some visual highlights of this repository include the program that re-creates a Hirst Dot Painting, my implementation of the Snake game, and my implemenation of Pong:
